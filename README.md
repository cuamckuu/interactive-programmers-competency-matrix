# Interactive 'Programmer's Competency Matrix' with Vue

> This is an interactive version of 'Programmer Competency Matrix' originally created by [Sijin Joseph](https://sijinjoseph.netlify.app). The main difference is that, this version contains skills statistics and recomendations. Also your levels saved to localStorage, so don't be afraid to close tab and come back later.
